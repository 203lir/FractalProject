The main code is in the module1.py file. This usually takes about 3 minutes, but may be significantly longer if your computer does not have enough memory; it eats up about 16 GB of memory while running.

After running the module1.py file, 9 images will be generated, each with different box sizes from finding the box counting dimension of the random walk.

The kochcurvetest.py file generates a Koch curve, and determines the fractal dimension of the generated curve, in order to demonstrate that the algorithm used to find the fractal dimension agrees with others.

The linearregressiontest.py file tests the linear regression function included in the module1.py file.
